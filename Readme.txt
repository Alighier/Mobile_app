Django project created to provide api services for our mobile app.
Definitely not finished. Definitely no without bugs... but it was working with our app.
My first Django project created with help of documentations and tutorials.

sftp-config -- file created for auto-connect between my sublime text editor and VM with this app. 
Not part of a project but I don't want to lose it.

If sth not working - propably no __init__ file
